This is my Bowling Game I made with Unity. The goal of the game is to hit as many pins as you can with your bowling ball!

There is a score system keeping tracking of the number of pins you hit. If you throw your ball into the gutter, you won't hit any pins!

Controls:
1. Move the Player left or right - Press/Hold A and D Keys
2. Change the throwing direction - Drag your mouse in any direction
3. Release the Bowling Ball - Press SpaceBar
4. Reset the Pins - Press R Key
